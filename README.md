# digital-Air-marker
 **Overview**
The Digital Air Marker is a smart prototype that recognizes digits (0â€“9) drawn in the air using hand gestures. It uses an MPU6050 IMU sensor and an ESP32 microcontroller to capture motion, which is then interpreted by a deep learning model to identify the digit written â€” enabling new forms of non-touch human-computer interaction.

**Key** **Features**

 Motion Tracking using MPU6050 (6-axis IMU)

 Digit Recognition powered by LSTM-based machine learning

 Push-button gesture initiation

 Real-time data capture and model prediction via Python

 No touchscreen or keyboard needed
